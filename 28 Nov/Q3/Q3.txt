Palindrome count

Problem Statement

Write a function to find all the words in a string which are palindrome.

Note

A string is said to be a palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as string. 
For example, "abba‚Äù is a palindrome, but "abbc" is not a palindrome.

Example1

Input

this is level 71

Output

1

Explanation

The reverse of the word "level" is "level". Hence, the word is a palindrome. 
As the string contains only one palindrome, so the returned value will be 1.

Example2

Input

 hello world 

Output

0

Explanation

No palindrome string in the sentence so print 0.

Input format :
Input1: string 

Output format :
Return the number of palindromes in the given string

Sample test cases :
Input 1 : this is level 71
Output 1 : 1
Input 2 : hello world
Output 2 : 0
