Hands of the clock 

Problem statement

You are given a string input time = 'ABCD' where AB denotes the hours from 00 to 12 and CD 
denotes the minutes from 00 to 59, in a 12-hour format. 

Your task is to write a program to calculate the smallest angle between the hour hand and 
the minute hand of a clock, for the given time.

Note

Return your answer with up to 1 decimal place

Example 1

Input

0906

Output

123.0 

Explanation

123.0 degrees is the smallest angle formed between the hour hand and the minute hand at 0906 a.m or 0906 p.m

Example 2 

Input

0156

Output

82.0

Explanation

82.0 degrees is the smallest angle formed between the hour hand and minute hand at 0156 a.m. or 0156 p.m

Input format 
The first line contains a string time, denoting the time in the 12-hours format

Output format 
The output prints a float denoting the smallest angle between the hour and the minute hand for the given time

Code constraints 
1 = len(time) = 105

Sample test cases 
Input 1 : 0906
