Superior elements

Problem statement

In an array, a superior element is one that is greater than all elements to its right. 
The rightmost element will always be considered as a superior element. You are given a function,

Int findnumberofsuperiorelements(int* arr, int n);

The function accepts an integer array ‘arr’ and its length ‘n’. 
Implement the function to find and return the number of superior elements in array ‘arr’.

Example

Input

5

7 9 5 2 8 7

Output

3

Explanation

9 is greater than all the elements to its right, 8 is greater than the element to its right, 
and 7 is the rightmost element. Hence total 3 superior elements.

Input format :
The first integer is the array size.

The next line of integers is the array elements.

Output format :
Output is an integer denoting the number of superior elements.

Code constraints :
1)     n>0

2)     array index starts from 0.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
2 5 3 4 8
Output 1 : 1
Input 2 :
5
5 2 5 4 3 
Output 2 : 3
