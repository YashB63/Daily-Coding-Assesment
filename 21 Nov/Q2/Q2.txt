Examplel

Input

3

132

Output

2

Explanation

The order that incurs the minimum penalty is 1, 2, 3. 
The penalty is abs(2-1) + abs(3-2) = 2

Example2

Input

4

16-24

Output

8

Explanation

The order that incurs the minimum penalty is -2, 1, 4, 6. 
The penalty is abs(6-4) + abs(4-1) + abs(1-(-2)) = 2+3 +3=8.

Input format:

inputl: length of an integer array of number (2<=input 1<=1000).

input2: integer array (1<= input 2[i]<=10000).

Output format:

Return the minimum penalty
