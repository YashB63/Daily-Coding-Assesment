Problem Statement

You are required to implement the following function 

int MaxExponents (int a, int b);

You have to find and return the number between 'a' and 'b' ( range inclusive on both ends) 
which has the maximum exponent of 2.

The algorithm to find the number with a maximum exponent of 2 between the given range is

1. Loop between 'a' and 'b'. Let the looping variable be '1'. 2. 
Find the exponent (power) of 2 for each 'i' and store the number with a maximum exponent of 2 
so far in a variable, let say 'max'. Set 'max' to 'i' only if 'i' has more exponent of 2 than 'max'.

3. Return 'max'.

Assumption

a<b

Note

If two or more numbers in the range have the same exponents of 2, return the small number.

Example

Input

7

12

Output

8

Explanation

Exponents of 2 in:

7-0

8-3

9-0

10-1

12-2

Hence maximum exponent if two is 8.

Input format:

Integer values of a and b.

Output format:

Maximum exponent value
