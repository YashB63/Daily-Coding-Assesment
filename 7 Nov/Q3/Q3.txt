Sum of numbers with set bit

You are given a function, 

int SumofSetBitNumbers(int n, int set);

The function accepts two integers ‘n’ and ‘set’ as its argument where ‘n’ is the number of bits 
and ‘set’ is the number of set bits. Implement the function to find the sum of all numbers 
possible from ‘n’ bits having the count of ‘set’ bits equal to set.

Note

n > 0

set >= 0

Example

Input

n: 3

set: 2

Output

14

Explanation

All possible 3 bit numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 with binary representation 
000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111. Numbers with 2 bits set are 3, 5 and 6 summation of which is equal to 14.

Input format :
The first line of integer input represents the number of bits

The second line of integer input represents the number of set bits in the binary representation.

Output format :
Sum of all possible decimal values of n bits with the exact number of set bits.

Sample test cases :
