Count occurrences of a digit

Problem statement

Implement the following function: 

int CountDigiOoccurrences(int l, int u, int x);

The function accepts 3 positive integers ‘l’, 'u' and 'x' as its arguments. 
You are required to calculate the number of occurrences of a digit 'x' in the 
digits of numbers lying in the range between ‘I’ and 'u' both inclusive, and return the same. 

Note

I < u

0 < x < 9

Example

Input

I: 2

u: 13

x: 3

Output

2

Explanation

The number of occurrences of digit 3 in the digits of numbers lying in the range 
[2, 13] both inclusive is 2, ie (3, 13), hence 2 is returned.

Input format :
The input accepts the three integers separated by a new line as given in the question.

Output format :
The output is a single integer type.
