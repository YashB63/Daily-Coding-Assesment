Cut and Add

Problem Statement

Harry and Potter took a word string. 
Harry chose a number M (less than the length of the string) and 
Potter chose N (less than the length of the string). 
Harry will cut M alphabets from the end of the string and then 
add it to the beginning and will give it to Potter. 

Then, Potter will also cut N alphabets from the end of the string, 
add it to the beginning and then give to Harry. 
This process will continue till they get the original word string back. 
For a given string and given values of M and N, find the number of turns 
in which they will get the original word string back.
