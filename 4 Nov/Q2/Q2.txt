Blocks

Problem statement

There are N floating blocks in a pond and they are arranged in a straight line. Each of these blocks has a value associated with them which is written on top of them. After every 1 minute, blocks at the odd position get submerged underwater. You must shift the remaining blocks to one position left to fill in emptied space. This process is repeated till only one block is left floating. 

You must return the value of the last block which is left floating. 

Note

The position index starts with 1 and blocks are numbered from 1 to N in the left to the right direction. It is given that N is always greater than 1. 

Example 1

Input

4

Output

4

Explanation

Initially, 1, 2, 3 and 4 numbered blocks are in the pond. After deleting the blocks at odd positions, 2 and 4 are remaining. After deleting the blocks at odd positions, 4 remains. So, the output is 4.

Example 2

Input

7

Output

4

Explanation

Initially, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 numbered blocks are in the pond. After deleting the blocks at odd positions, 2, 4 and 6 are remaining. After deleting the blocks at odd positions, 4 remains. So, the output is 4.



Input format :
The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of blocks floating in a pond initially. 

Output format :
The output prints an integer denoting the value of the last block which is left floating.

Code constraints :
1<=N<=105 

Sample test cases :
Input 1 : 4
Output 1 : 4
Input 2 : 7
Output 2 : 4
