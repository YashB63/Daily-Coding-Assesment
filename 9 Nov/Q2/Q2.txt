Highest Common Factor

Problem statement

Find the HCF (Highest Common Factor) of n numbers given in an integer array. 
Fill in the function HCF() and return the HCF

Example 1

Input

input1: 3

input2: {2, 4, 8}

Output

2

Explanation

The common factor for 2, 4, 8 are 1 and 2. 
Hence the HCF (Highest Common Factor) is 2.

Example 2

Input

input1: 5

input2: {10, 15, 20, 35, 70}

Output

5

Explanation

The common factor for 10, 15, 20, 35, 70 are 1 and 5. 
Hence the HCF (Highest Common Factor) is 5.

Input format :
