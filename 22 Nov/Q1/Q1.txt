Largest subarray

Problem Statement

Given an array containing only Os and 1s, find the length of the largest 
subarray containing an equal number of Os and 1s.

Example1

Input

4

1 1 0 1

Output

2

Explanation

Largest possible array here would be of length 2 as there should be equal number of 0 and 1 in it. 
The starting index and ending index of the largest subarray is 1 and 2. Hence the output is 2.

Example2

Input

5

1 1 1 1 1

Output

0

Explanation

In the above example, there are no Os in the array. Hence the output is 0.

Input format:

input1: N, the length of an array input2: Array containing 0s and 1s

Output format:

Return the length of the largest sub-array containing equal no. of 0s and 1s
