Maximum revenue garage

Problem statement

A Garage is represented as:

struct Garage

{

int bikes;

int cars;

int trucks;

};

Implement the function

int MaxRevenue(struct Garage garages[], int m);

The function accepts an array 'garages' of type 'Garage' consisting of 'm' elements as its argument. 
Each element of garages consists of three non-negative integers 'bikes', 'cars' and 'trucks' referring 
to the count of bikes, cars and trucks in a garage respectively. 
The cost of servicing a bike, car and truck are 100, 250 and 500 respectively. 
Implement the function to calculate the revenue generated by each garage and return 
the maximum revenue generated. Revenue generated by garage = (100 * bikes) + (250 * cars) + (500 * trucks).

Note

1. Computed value lies within integer range

2. Return -1 if 'garages' is null(or None in the case of python)
