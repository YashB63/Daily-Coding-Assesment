You are required to implement the following function 

int FindNumbersDivisible(int a, int b, int divi): 

The function takes three positive integers a, b and divi as input. 
Implement the function to find and return the count of all those numbers between 'a' and b' 
(both inclusive) which are divisible by 'divi'.

Input format:

The three input integers are the values of a, b and divi respectively.

Output format:

The output integer is the count of numbers divisible by div from a to b.
