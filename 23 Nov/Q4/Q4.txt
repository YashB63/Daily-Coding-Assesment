Problem Statement

A carry is a digit that is transferred to the left if the sum of digits 
exceeds 9 while adding two numbers from right-to-left one digit at a time 

You are required to implement the following function 

int NumberOfCarries (int num1, int num2); 

The functions accept two numbers 'num1' and 'num2' as their arguments. 
You are required to calculate and return the total number of carriers generated 
while adding digits of two numbers 'num1' and ' num2'.

Assumption

num1, num2 >= 0

Example

Input

451

349

Output

2

Explanation:

Adding 'num 1' and 'num 2' right-to-left results in 2 carries since (1+9) is 10. 
1 is carried and (5+4=1) is 10, again 1 is carried. Hence 2 is returned.

Input format:

Input integers are the values of num1 & num2 respectively.

Output format:

Output integer is the number of carrying operations.
