Problem statement

N-base notation is a system for writing numbers that use only n different symbols, 
This symbols are the first n symbols from the given notation list(Including the symbol for o) 
Decimal to n base notation are (0:0, 1:1, 2:2, 3:3, 4:4, 5:5, 6:6, 7:7, 8:8, 9:9, 10:A,11:B and so on up to 35:Z) 
You are required to implement the following function

char* DectoNBase (int n, int num); The function accepts positive integer n and num 
Implement the function to calculate the n- base equivalent of num and return the same as a string Steps:

1. Divide the decimal number by n, Treat the division as the integer division

2. Write the remainder (in n-base notation) 

3. Divide the quotient again by n, Treat the division as integer division 

4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until the quotient is 0

5. The n-base value is the sequence of the remainders from last to first

Assumption

1< n <= 36

Example

Input

n: 12

num: 718

Output

4BA

Explanation

num Divisor quotient remainder

718 12 59 10(A)

59 12 4 11(B)

4 12 0 4(4)

Input format:

The first line of input contains an integer denoting the value of n.

The second line of input contains an integer denoting the value of num.

Output format:

The output prints the N-base notation.
