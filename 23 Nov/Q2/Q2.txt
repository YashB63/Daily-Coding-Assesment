You are required to implement the following function int LargeSmallSum(int arr[]);

The function accepts an integer arr of size 'length' as its arguments 
you are required to return the sum of the second largest element from 
the even positions and the second smallest from the odd position of given 'arr' 

Assumption

All array elements are unique 
Treat the 0th position a seven Note

Return 0, if the array is empty 
Return 0, if array length is 3 or less than 3

Example

Input

6

3 2 1 7 5 4

Output

7

Explanation

Second largest among even position elements (1 3 5) is

3

Second smallest among odd position elements (7 4 2) is 4

Thus output is 3+4 = 7

Input format:

The first input is the size of the array

The next line of integers is the array of elements

Output format:

The output integer is the result as required.
