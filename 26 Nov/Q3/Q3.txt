Nth character in Decrypted String

Problem Statement

Every character in the input string is followed by its frequency. 
Write a function to decrypt the string and find the nth character of the decrypted string. 
If no character exists at that position then return “-1”. 
For eq:- if the input string is “a2b3” the decrypted string is “aabbb”

Note

The frequency of encrypted string cannot be greater than a single digit i.e., < 10.

Example1

Input

a1b1c3

5

Output

c

Explanation

The decrypted string is “abccc”, hence the 5th character in the decrypted string is “c”.

Example2

Input

a3b2

7

Output

-1

Explanation

The decrypted string is “aaabb”. Since the length of the decrypted string is less.

Input format :
Input1: a string

Input2: n, the position of the character starting from 1

Output format :
Return the character which occurs at the nth position in the decrypted string. 
Return “-1” if no character exists at that position.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
a1b1c3
5
Output 1 : c
Input 2 :
a3b2
7
Output 2 : -1
