Arithmetic Progression

Problem statement

Given the second and the third terms of an AP (-10^6 <= a2, a3 <= 10^6), 
find the nth (1 <= n <= 1000) term of the sequence

Example 1

Input

input1: 1

input2: 2

input3: 4

Output

3

Explanation

a2 = 1, a3 = 2, n = 4 d = 1 an = a4 = 3 
(d refers to the common difference between adjacent terms in an arithmetic progression)

Example 2

Input

input1: 5

input2: 8

input3: 4

Output

11

Explanation

a2 = 5, a3 = 8, n = 4 d = 3, an = a4 = 11 
(d refers to the common difference between adjacent terms in an arithmetic progression)



Input format :
