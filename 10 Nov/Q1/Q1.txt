Longest common subsequence

Problem statement

Given two strings, 'x' and 'y' (1 <= length(x), length(y) <= 1000), 
find the length of their Longest Common subsequence (LCS). 
The strings contains only lowercase letters.

Write a program that takes in two string inputs and returns the length of their LCS.

Example 1

Input

input1: aba 

input2: ababa

Output

3

Explanation

The length of the longest common subsequence is 3 that is "aba".

Example2

Input

input1: aggtab 

input2: gxtxayb

Output

4

Explanation 

The length of the longest common subsequence is 4 that is "gtab"

Input format :
input1: input string 'x'

input2: input string 'y'

Output format :
Return the length of the LCS of 'x' and 'y'.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
aba
ababa
Output 1 : 3
Input 2 :
aggtab
gxtxayb
Output 2 : 4
